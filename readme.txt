The complete solution for WordPress comments. Features Custom Guest/User Avatars, Multi-Captcha Protection, User Bios, and Verified Badges.

== Description ==

**Comment Avatar & CAPTCHA Pro** is the ultimate plugin to enhance and secure your comment section. 

It solves three major problems:
1.  **Identity:** Allows guests and users to upload custom avatars (replacing Gravatar).
2.  **Security:** Blocks spam bots using your choice of Google reCAPTCHA, Cloudflare Turnstile, hCaptcha, or Simple Math.
3.  **Community:** Adds "Verified" badges and User Bios to comments.

**Key Features:**
* **Drag & Drop Uploads:** Guests can easily upload a photo for their comment.
* **4 Security Modes:** Google reCAPTCHA v2, Cloudflare Turnstile, hCaptcha, and Math Logic.
* **User Bios:** Allow users to add a short (8-word) bio to their comment.
* **Verified Badges:** Admin can label users (e.g., "Verified", "Team") which appear next to their name.
* **Comment Counts:** Users can optionally display their total number of comments.
